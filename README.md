# Signynt's Darkroom Shortcut
Signynt's Darkroom Shortcut constitutes a workflow for film negative inversion with dust or scratch removal. 
It consists of an Apple Workflow, three shell scripts that utilize Imagemagick (made by [Fred Weinhaus](http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/index.php) and [Jaz99](https://www.flickr.com/people/jaz99)), and an Affinity Photo macro if you would like to use the dust removal option.

Using this shortcut gives you quick access to high quality, neutral and ready to edit RAW images with just one click. It also optionally provides access to quick and high quality dust or scratch removal that is better than the scanning softwares automatic options.

## Installation
Please read the instructions carefully, and use the YouTube video if you have trouble understanging any of the steps. If you still are having trouble, open an [Issue](https://github.com/Signynt/signynts-darkroom-shortcut/issues/new/choose), or DM me on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Signynt).

1. Install [Imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org):

The easiest way to do this is using [Brew](https://brew.sh).

If you don't yet have [Brew](https://brew.sh) installed, paste this command in to the Terminal:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once [Brew](https://brew.sh) is installed run these two commands in the Terminal to install [Imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org) with libtiff support:
```
brew install libtiff
```
	
```
brew install imagemagick
```
You can now close the Terminal.

2. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Signynt/signynts-darkroom-shortcut/archive/refs/tags/v1.3.zip) and open the zip file
3. Install the Apple Workflows that correspond to what kind of scans you are working with, and the software you use
	- For black & white scans, install `Signynt's Darkroom Shortcut (B&W).workflow`
	- For color negative scans that were scanned without IR, install `Signynt's Darkroom Shortcut.workflow`
	- For color negative scans that were scanned with IR, find the folder that corresponds to your software, open it, and install the workflow and the macro inside
		- _Example: If you scan with Silverfast, and use Affinity Photo, open the folder called `Silverfast + Affinity Photo`, and double click on both `Signynt's Darkroom Shortcut (IR) (Silverfast-Affinity).workflow` and `Signynt's Darkroom Shortcut v.1.0.afmacros`_
	- If you are DSLR scanning, open the folder called `DSLR Scanning` and install `Convert to TIFF.workflow`
4. Install the scripts:

Open Finder and in the Menu Bar select `Go > Go to Folder` and type  `usr/local/bin`, then hit enter. This will open up the `bin` folder. 

Drag and drop the three scripts called `autocolor`, `autolevel` and `negfix8` from the `scripts` folder to `bin`.

5. Enjoy! Test out the script on the [Example.tif](https://github.com/Signynt/signynts-darkroom-shortcut/releases/download/v1.1/Example.tif) file

If you have any trouble installing, try checking out my video tutorial to check if you are doing all the steps correctly.

> Important: If you get an error while trying to use the shortcut, one of the most common reasons this can be caused is a messed up `$PATH`. To fix this, open the Terminal and run this command: 
>```
>echo "export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
>```
> Close the Terminal and try the shortcut again, in most cases it will work now.

## How To Use
1. Scan a film negative as a RAW TIFF file, optionally select the infrared scan option
	- In Silverfast for example select `64 Bit HDRi RAW` as the scan option
2. Right click on the output file, hover over `Quick Actions`, then select your corresponding shortcut 
	- If you would like to process multiple files at once, simply select all the files you would like the invert, then right click
3. Wait for the shortcut to finish loading. While it is running you will see a cog in the Menu Bar spinning
4. Each processed image should now have a corresponding image labeled `-Inverted` at the end of the filename, and you're done! If you selected the IR option continue to the next step.
5. The parts of the image recognized as dust or scratches will appear as if they have been ereased. To fix these parts of the image open it in Affinity Photo or Photoshop
6. **For Affinity Photo**: In the macros folder called `Signynt's Darkroom Shortcut v.1.0` select the macro called `Remove Dust`
	- You can check to see if you are happy with the infill by comparing the layer called `Dust Removed` with the layer called `Image`. If you want to do the removal in a specific part of the image, erease the `Dust Removed` layer in that spot. If there is more dust that wasn't removed, you can select the `Inpainting Brush Tool` and remove them manually
6. **For Photoshop**: In the macros folder called `Signynt's Darkroom Shortcut v.1.0` select the macro called `Remove Dust`
	- You can check to see if you are happy with the infill by comparing the layer called `Dust Removed` with the layer called `Image`. If you want to do the removal in a specific part of the image, erease the `Dust Removed` layer in that spot. If there is more dust that wasn't removed, you can select the `Inpainting Brush Tool` and remove them manually
7. Edit the image to your liking and export it!

### Use with DSLR Scans

The workflow requires input images to be TIFF files, however most DSLR cameras output other RAW formats, such as NEF, ARW or DNG. 
In those cases the images must first be converted to TIFF files, which can be done with the workflow which you will find in the `DSLR Scanning` folder (double click `Convert to TIFF.worflow` to install it). 

Before using the workflow as described above you must first follow these steps:

1. Select all you DSLR scans
2. Right click, hover over `Quick Actions`, then select `Convert to TIFF`

After running you will have a duplicate of each image which is a TIFF file, and is labeled as such. You can then select these and run them through the workflow as described above. Please note you can not use the IR version with DSLR scans.

> Important: Make sure you crop the image too remove any of the lighttable that might be visible in the image, otherwise you will run into errors!
